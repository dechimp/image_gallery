[Demo](http://dechimp.work/image_gallery/)   (This is hosted on heroku so it may take 15-30 seconds to load.)

A form I made (but havent used) for picking an image or choosing a solid color.  It's more of a concept than a plugin. 

Uses [Farbtastic](http://acko.net/blog/farbtastic-jquery-color-picker-plug-in/) for the color picker. Uses LESS for stylesheets.
